# Ratchet - CSS3 Transform Parser

Ratchet assists with the process of dissecting CSS3 transform strings into
javascript objects that you can then do something more intelligent with.

## Example Usage

Displayed below is a simple example.  First a html file with a div element
styled to look like a square box:

```html
<html>
<body>
<style type="text/css">
#box { width: 50px; height: 50px; background: red; }
</style>
<div id="box"></div>
<script src="simple-bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

And then some JS that can be used to manipulate the transform of the box (
in partnership with the [feature](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/feature)
module):

```js
var ratchet = require('ratchet');
var transform = require('feature/css')('transform');

var box = document.getElementById('box');
var t = transform && ratchet(transform(box));

if (t) {
  setInterval(function() {
    t.translate.x.value += 2;
    t.rotate.z.value += 5;

    transform(box, t.toString());
  }, 1000 / 60);
}

```

If you want to give this a go you should be able to run the example with
[bde](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/bde) simply type `npm run example`
in the repository once cloned an dependencies have been installed.

Assuming it is working, you will see a square red box, moving
and rotating towards the right of the screen.
